## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pharmacare-frontend
```

2. Navigate to the program directory:
```bash
cd program
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the `program` directory with the following variables:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://pharmacare-api.onrender.com/api
# Add other environment variables as needed
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

### Available Scripts

In the project directory (`program` folder), you can run:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with hot reloading
- `npm run start`: Alias for the dev script
- `npm run build`: Creates an optimized production build
- `npm run preview`: Locally previews the production build
- `npm run lint`: Checks code for linting errors
- `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fixes linting errors
- `npm run format`: Formats code using Prettier

### Environment Configuration

The application uses the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable for all API requests in every environment (development and production). No dev-time proxy is configured in `vite.config.js`; the frontend talks directly to the backend URL you set in `.env`.

## Role-Based Access

The application implements a robust role-based access control system:

### User Roles
1. **Admin**: Platform-wide management, user management, billing, system statistics
2. **Manager**: Branch management, staff oversight, inventory control, reporting
3. **Pharmacist**: Prescription handling, inventory management, stock receiving
4. **Cashier**: Point-of-sale transactions, receipt generation, session management

### Access Control
- Protected routes are implemented using the `RoleProtectedRoute` component
- Users are automatically redirected based on their role after authentication
- Each role has specific permissions and accessible features

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API hosted at `https://pharmacare-api.onrender.com`. API calls are managed through:
- Dedicated API client in `src/api/apiClient.js`
- Service layers for business logic in `src/services/`
- Authentication tokens stored in localStorage
